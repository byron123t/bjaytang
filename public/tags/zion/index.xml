      <description>A Hectic Week If there&amp;rsquo;s anything I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from this trip, it&amp;rsquo;s to check all conference deadlines before booking any plane tickets. Proofreading, writing, fixing plots &amp;ndash; these activities filled my first day. I missed out on fully appreciating riveting events such as a 4 hour plane ride, the 108 degree Vegas sun, a 2 hour drive through the desert, grocery shopping, and cooking dinner. While I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind missing out on this stuff again, it was the all nighter (6am submission) followed by the 4 hour morning hike which really did a number on me.</description>
