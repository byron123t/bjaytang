Existing defenses against adversarial inputs have largely been detached from the real world. These defenses also come at a cost to accuracy. Fortunately, there are invariances of an object that are its salient features; when we break them it will necessarily change the perception of the object.","date":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_001/","tags":["ML","Security","Preprint"],"title":"Rearchitecting Classification Frameworks For Increased Robustness"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Authors Duc Bui , Brian Tang, Kang G. Shin Conference Under review at 29th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (2022)\nAbstract All major web browsers support extensions to provide additional functionalities and enhance usersâ€™ browsing experience while the extensions can access and collect usersâ€™ data during their web browsing. Although web extensions inform users of their data practices via multiple forms of notices, prior work has overlooked the gap between the actual data practices and the published privacy notices of browser extensions.","date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_007/","tags":["ML","Privacy","NLP","Preprint"],"title":"Do Opt-Outs Really Opt Me Out"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Authors Duc Bui , Brian Tang, Kang G.

However, little is known about how robots might appropriately discern the sensitivity of information, which has major implications for human-robot trust. As a first step to address a part of this issue, we designed a privacy controller, CONFIDANT, for conversational social robots, capable of using contextual metadata (e.","date":"2022-03-07T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_004/","tags":["ML","Privacy","HRI","HCI","Conference"],"title":"CONFIDANT: A Privacy Controller for Social Robots"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Authors Harrison Rosenberg , Brian Tang, Kassem Fawaz , Somesh Jha Conference Under review at 32nd USENIX Security Symposium (2023)\nAbstract The proliferation of automated face recognition in various commercial and government sectors has caused significant privacy concerns for individuals. A recent, popular approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ evasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering face recognition systems. Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptible perturbations, when added to an image, cause the face recognition system to misidentify the user.","date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_003/","tags":["ML","Security","Privacy","Fairness","Preprint"],"title":"Fairness Properties of Face Recognition and Obfuscation Systems"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Authors Brian Tang, Kang G.

As a result, the information accessed and stored within mobile devices, such as financial and health information, text messages, and emails, can often be sensitive. Despite this, people frequently use their mobile devices in public areas, becoming susceptible to a simple yet effective attack â€“ shoulder surfing.","date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_008/","tags":["Mobile","Privacy","Security","Preprint","HCI"],"title":"Real-Time Protection of Mobile Device Screen Information from Shoulder Surfing"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Authors Duc Bui , Brian Tang, Kang G.
