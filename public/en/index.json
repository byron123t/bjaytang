Existing defenses against adversarial inputs have largely been detached from the real world. These defenses also come at a cost to accuracy. Fortunately, there are invariances of an object that are its salient features; when we break them it will necessarily change the perception of the object.","date":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_001/","tags":["ML","Security","Preprint"],"title":"Rearchitecting Classification Frameworks For Increased Robustness"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Authors Duc Bui , Brian Tang, Kang G.

However, little is known about how robots might appropriately discern the sensitivity of information, which has major implications for human-robot trust. As a first step to address a part of this issue, we designed a privacy controller, CONFIDANT, for conversational social robots, capable of using contextual metadata (e.","date":"2022-03-07T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_004/","tags":["ML","Privacy","HRI","HCI","Conference"],"title":"CONFIDANT: A Privacy Controller for Social Robots"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Authors Harrison Rosenberg , Brian Tang, Kassem Fawaz , Somesh Jha Conference Under review at 32nd USENIX Security Symposium (2023)\nAbstract The proliferation of automated face recognition in various commercial and government sectors has caused significant privacy concerns for individuals. A recent, popular approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ evasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering face recognition systems. Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptible perturbations, when added to an image, cause the face recognition system to misidentify the user.","date":"2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_003/","tags":["ML","Security","Privacy","Fairness","Preprint"],"title":"Fairness Properties of Face Recognition and Obfuscation Systems"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Authors Brian Tang, Kang G.

Coupled with the abundant information they have about users, service providers can associate users with social interactions, visited places, activities, and preferences\u0026ndash;some of which the user may not want to share.","date":"2021-07-11T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.bjaytang.com/en/projects/post_002/","tags":["ML","Security","Privacy","Conference"],"title":"Face-Off: Adversarial Face Obfuscation"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Biosketch I’m a 1st year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Michigan and a member of the Real-Time Computing Lab (advised by Prof. Kang Shin ).
