      <description>Authors Varun Chandrasekaran , Brian Tang, Nicolas Papernot , Kassem Fawaz , Somesh Jha , Xi Wu Abstract While generalizing well over natural inputs, neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial inputs. Existing defenses against adversarial inputs have largely been detached from the real world. These defenses also come at a cost to accuracy. Fortunately, there are invariances of an object that are its salient features; when we break them it will necessarily change the perception of the object.</description>

Abstract All major web browsers support extensions to provide additional functionalities and enhance users’ browsing experience while the extensions can access and collect users’ data during their web browsing. Although web extensions inform users of their data practices via multiple forms of notices, prior work has overlooked the gap between the actual data practices and the published privacy notices of browser extensions.</description>

Abstract Online services increasingly provide users with cookie consent settings to accept/reject the cookies placed on their web browsers. Unlike other GDPR-specific requirements, using cookies without user consent would violate consumer protection laws anywhere in the world. However, little has been done to understand the violations of users’ cookie consent/rejection from a global standpoint.</description>

Abstract As social robots become increasingly prevalent in day-to-day environments, they will participate in conversations and appropriately manage the information shared with them. However, little is known about how robots might appropriately discern the sensitivity of information, which has major implications for human-robot trust. As a first step to address a part of this issue, we designed a privacy controller, CONFIDANT, for conversational social robots, capable of using contextual metadata (e.</description>

      <description>Authors Harrison Rosenberg , Brian Tang, Kassem Fawaz , Somesh Jha Conference Under review at 32nd USENIX Security Symposium (2023)
Abstract The proliferation of automated face recognition in various commercial and government sectors has caused significant privacy concerns for individuals. A recent, popular approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ evasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering face recognition systems. Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptible perturbations, when added to an image, cause the face recognition system to misidentify the user.</description>

      <description>Authors Duc Bui , Brian Tang, Kang G. Shin Conference Conditionally accepted at 43rd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2022)
Abstract Online trackers, such as advertising and analytics service companies, have provided users with choices to opt out of their tracking and data collection to mitigate the users’ concerns of increasing privacy risks. While opt-out choices of online services for the cookies placed on their own websites have been examined before, the choices provided by trackers for their third-party tracking services on publisher websites have been largely overlooked.</description>

      <description>Authors Varun Chandrasekaran , Chuhan Gao , Brian Tang, Kassem Fawaz , Somesh Jha , Suman Banerjee Conference 21st Symposium Privacy Enhancing Technologies (2021)
Abstract Advances in deep learning have made face recognition technologies pervasive. While useful to social media platforms and users, this technology carries significant privacy threats. Coupled with the abundant information they have about users, service providers can associate users with social interactions, visited places, activities, and preferences&amp;ndash;some of which the user may not want to share.</description>
