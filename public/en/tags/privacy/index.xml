Abstract As social robots become increasingly prevalent in day-to-day environments, they will participate in conversations and appropriately manage the information shared with them. However, little is known about how robots might appropriately discern the sensitivity of information, which has major implications for human-robot trust. As a first step to address a part of this issue, we designed a privacy controller, CONFIDANT, for conversational social robots, capable of using contextual metadata (e.</description>

      <description>Authors Harrison Rosenberg , Brian Tang, Kassem Fawaz , Somesh Jha Conference Under review at 32nd USENIX Security Symposium (2023)
Abstract The proliferation of automated face recognition in various commercial and government sectors has caused significant privacy concerns for individuals. A recent, popular approach to address these privacy concerns is to employ evasion attacks against the metric embedding networks powering face recognition systems. Face obfuscation systems generate imperceptible perturbations, when added to an image, cause the face recognition system to misidentify the user.</description>

      <description>Authors Varun Chandrasekaran , Chuhan Gao , Brian Tang, Kassem Fawaz , Somesh Jha , Suman Banerjee Conference 21st Symposium Privacy Enhancing Technologies (2021)
Abstract Advances in deep learning have made face recognition technologies pervasive. While useful to social media platforms and users, this technology carries significant privacy threats. Coupled with the abundant information they have about users, service providers can associate users with social interactions, visited places, activities, and preferences&amp;ndash;some of which the user may not want to share.</description>
