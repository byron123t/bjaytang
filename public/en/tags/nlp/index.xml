Abstract All major web browsers support extensions to provide additional functionalities and enhance users’ browsing experience while the extensions can access and collect users’ data during their web browsing.

      <description>Authors Duc Bui , Brian Tang, Kang G. Shin Conference Conditionally accepted at 43rd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (2022)
Abstract Online trackers, such as advertising and analytics service companies, have provided users with choices to opt out of their tracking and data collection to mitigate the users’ concerns of increasing privacy risks.
