      <description>Biosketch Iâ€™m a 1st year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Michigan and a member of the Real-Time Computing Lab (advised by Prof. Kang Shin ). Currently, my research focuses on the intersection between usable privacy and machine learning. As an undergraduate student, I was a part of the Wisconsin Privacy and Security Group working with Prof. Kassem Fawaz , Prof. Varun Chandrasekaran , and Prof. Somesh Jha on machine learning security and privacy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to teach and TA with the extra time I&amp;rsquo;ll have after finishing my PhD course requirements. Along with teaching at the University of Michigan, I&amp;rsquo;d like to volunteer and teach Computer Science at K-12 schools.</description>
