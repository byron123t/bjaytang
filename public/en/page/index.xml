      <description>Biosketch I’m a 1st year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Michigan and a member of the Real-Time Computing Lab (advised by Prof. Kang Shin ). Currently, my research focuses on the intersection between usable privacy and machine learning. As an undergraduate student, I was a part of the Wisconsin Privacy and Security Group working with Prof. Kassem Fawaz , Prof. Varun Chandrasekaran , and Prof. Somesh Jha on machine learning security and privacy.</description>

      <description>Overview Here, I host a list of all the papers I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with as well as some of my course and research notes. Unfortunately, I can&amp;rsquo;t share papers undergoing revision/review. Some titles have been altered to ensure reviewers are unable to search for papers undergoing review. Finally I have some recommendations for papers that left a big impact on me and my research.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to teach and TA with the extra time I&amp;rsquo;ll have after finishing my PhD course requirements. Along with teaching at the University of Michigan, I&amp;rsquo;d like to volunteer and teach Computer Science at K-12 schools.</description>
