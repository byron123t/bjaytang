## Overview

Here, I host a list of all the papers I've been involved with as well as some of my course and research notes. Unfortunately, I can't share papers undergoing revision/review. Our lab has a policy of not hosting papers undergoing review on arXiv (to ensure double-blind review). Finally I have some recommendations for papers that left a big impact on me and my research.

## Publications/Papers

- [CONFIDANT: A Privacy Controller for Social Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02712)
- [Fairness Properties of Face Recognition and Obfuscation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02707)
- [Face-Off: Adversarial Face Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08861)
