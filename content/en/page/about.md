## Biosketch

I’m a 1st year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Michigan and a member of the [Real-Time Computing Lab](https://rtcl.eecs.umich.edu/rtclweb/) (advised by [Prof. Kang Shin]({{<param shinURL>}})). Currently, my research focuses on the intersection between usable privacy and machine learning. As an undergraduate student, I was a part of the [Wisconsin Privacy and Security Group](https://wiscprivacy.com/) working with [Prof. {{<param kassem>}}]({{<param kassemURL>}}), [Prof. {{<param varun>}}]({{<param varunURL>}}), and [Prof. {{<param somesh>}}]({{<param someshURL>}}) on machine learning security and privacy. In the past, I have interned at [Roblox Corporation](https://corp.roblox.com/) and [Optum (UHG)](https://www.optum.com/) as a software engineer. Despite the challenges, I am having a wonderful time being a PhD student.

I am open to being hired for internships and residencies!
